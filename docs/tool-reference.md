# Tool Reference

`tool-manifest.json` is the source of truth for the canonical tool names exposed by this server.

Use this document as a grouped catalog. For exact schemas, your MCP client should inspect `tools/list`.

## Conventions

- Canonical names only: legacy alias names are not part of the public tool surface
- Document editing relies on AFFiNE WebSocket-backed operations where noted
- Experimental organize tools are marked explicitly
- Use `AFFINE_TOOL_PROFILE=read_only`, `core`, or `authoring` in production if you want a reduced surface
- Invalid profile, group, and tool names stop startup; the server never falls back to a broader surface

## Workspace

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list_workspaces` | List all available workspaces | Includes best-effort profile names, avatar references, and direct URLs; set `includeProfile: false` for a faster GraphQL-only response |
| `get_workspace` | Read workspace details | Includes permissions plus best-effort profile metadata and a direct URL |
| `create_workspace` | Create a workspace with an initial document | Destructive in the sense that it creates new server state |
| `update_workspace` | Update workspace settings | Requires at least one of `public` or `enableAi`; use carefully in shared workspaces |
| `delete_workspace` | Permanently delete a workspace | Destructive; `confirmWorkspaceId` must exactly match `id`; unconfirmed outcomes return an MCP error instead of a success receipt |
| `list_workspace_tree` | Return the workspace document hierarchy as a tree | Useful before moving docs; depth is limited to 0-20 |
| `get_orphan_docs` | Find documents that are not linked from a parent doc | Useful for cleanup and audits |

`list_workspaces` and `get_workspace` add `name`, `avatar`, `url`, and `profileStatus` to the existing GraphQL fields. `profileStatus` is `available`, `unavailable`, or `skipped`. Profile loading is best effort, so a realtime metadata failure leaves the GraphQL workspace visible with nullable profile fields. The `avatar` value is AFFiNE's stored avatar reference and is not guaranteed to be an external URL.

| `list_docs` | List documents with pagination | Includes `node.tags` |
| `list_tags` | List all tags in a workspace | |
| `search_docs` | Search titles with substring, prefix, or exact matching | Supports tag filter and updatedAt sorting; limit is 1-200 |

| `get_capabilities` | Inspect the server's high-level authoring and fidelity capabilities | Useful for adaptive clients |
| `analyze_doc_fidelity` | Analyze how a document maps to Markdown and which native AFFiNE structures are lossy | Good before export or migration |
| `list_children` | List direct child docs linked from a document | |

### Publish and visibility

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `publish_doc` | Make a document public | |
| `revoke_doc` | Revoke public access | |

### Create, duplicate, and move

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `create_doc` | Create a new document | WebSocket-backed |
| `create_doc_from_markdown` | Create a document from Markdown content | `[label](LinkedPage:<docId>)` links become native inline linked-doc references |
| `inspect_template_structure` | Inspect a template's native AFFiNE structure and native-clone support | Helps choose a clone strategy |
| `instantiate_template_native` | Instantiate a template via native AFFiNE block cloning, with optional Markdown fallback | Higher-fidelity than Markdown-only cloning |
| `move_doc` | Move a document in the sidebar by relinking it under another parent | Validates resources and cycles, adds the destination first, avoids duplicate links, and reports partial source-removal failures |
| `trash_doc` | Move a document to the AFFiNE trash | Recoverable with `restore_doc`; preserves document content and is safe to retry |
| `restore_doc` | Restore a document from the AFFiNE trash | Preserves document content and is safe to retry |
| `delete_doc` | Delete a document | WebSocket-backed and destructive; `confirmDocId` must exactly match `docId`, and metadata removal plus acknowledged or verified content deletion are reported separately |

### Content editing

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `update_doc_title` | Rename a document in workspace metadata and in the page block | |
| `update_doc_icon` | Set or clear a document's sidebar icon (emoji or named icon) | |
| `get_doc_icon` | Read a document's current sidebar icon | |
| `append_block` | Append canonical block types with validation and placement control | Inline-rich-text block content accepts a plain string or formatting-preserving delta array. Also supports media, embeds, database, and edgeless blocks. `frame`/`edgeless_text`/`note` accept `x`/`y`/`width`/`height`. `note` with `text` auto-creates a child paragraph. Bookmarks allow canonical web, mail, telephone, `affine://blob/<key>`, and `affine://doc/<id>` URLs; iframes require HTTP(S); provider embeds require HTTPS URLs on official hosts. URL validation does not make an outbound server fetch. Image and attachment `sourceId` values are exact opaque keys returned by `upload_blob`, including keys containing spaces or path separators. |
| `update_block` | Partially update an existing text block without changing its id | `text` accepts a plain string or formatting-preserving delta array. Also supports todo checked state, list style, and same-flavour paragraph/heading/quote conversions. Cross-flavour conversions are rejected because AFFiNE replaces the block id. |
| `update_table_cell` | Replace one cell in an existing AFFiNE table | Uses zero-based row/column coordinates, preserves arbitrary inline attributes, and keeps the first row bold. Plain-text updates preserve existing cell formatting when the text is unchanged. |
| `update_table_column_widths` | Set every column width in an existing AFFiNE table | Widths follow current column order. Values are 60–4096 px; `null` restores AFFiNE's automatic width. `read_doc` returns `tableColumnWidths` for exact readback and rollback. |
| `move_block` | Move or reorder an existing block without changing its id | Reuses `append_block` placement (`parentId`, `beforeBlockId`, `afterBlockId`, or `index`) and rejects root moves and cycles. |
| `create_semantic_page` | Create an AFFiNE-native page with an intentional section skeleton and native block composition | High-level authoring helper |
| `append_semantic_section` | Append a semantic section to an existing page by heading title | High-level authoring helper |
| `append_markdown` | Append Markdown content to an existing document | |
| `replace_doc_with_markdown` | Replace the main note content with Markdown | Applies the replacement as an all-or-nothing local batch; empty output requires `allowEmpty: true` |

#### Formatting-preserving block text

For inline-rich-text blocks, `append_block.text`, `update_block.text`, and `update_table_cell.text` accept either a string or a delta array. Each delta requires a string `insert` and may contain arbitrary `attributes`; the server passes attributes through without restricting them to a fixed formatting vocabulary.

```json
[
  { "insert": "plain " },
  { "insert": "colored", "attributes": { "color": "var(--affine-text-highlight-foreground-blue)" } },
  { "insert": " highlighted", "attributes": { "background": "var(--affine-text-highlight-yellow)" } }
]
```

`read_doc` block rows and block snapshots returned by editing tools include both flattened `text` and formatting-preserving `deltas`; table rows additionally include the full `tableData` matrix and `tableCellDeltas`. Markdown export still reports and drops inline attributes it cannot represent; use `deltas` for lossless block-level read/modify/write flows.

### Tags

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `create_tag` | Create a reusable workspace-level tag | |
| `add_tag_to_doc` | Attach a tag to a document | |
| `remove_tag_from_doc` | Detach a tag from a document | |
| `delete_tag` | Delete a workspace tag and detach it from every document | Destructive; accepts a tag id or name, rejects an ambiguous name |

### Custom properties

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list_doc_properties` | List workspace custom-property definitions and a document's current values | WebSocket-backed; reads the `db$docProperties` / `db$docCustomPropertyInfo` sub-docs |
| `create_custom_property` | Create a workspace-wide custom property definition | Types: `text`, `number`, `checkbox`, `date`. Returns the `propertyId` |
| `delete_custom_property` | Soft-delete a custom property definition by id or name | Destructive; existing values are hidden |
| `set_doc_property` | Set a document's custom property value by property id or name | Value validated per type (`checkbox` boolean, `number`, `date` `YYYY-MM-DD`, `text`) |
| `clear_doc_property` | Remove a custom property value from a document | |

### Markdown export

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `export_doc_markdown` | Export document content as Markdown | Preserves supported inline rich text and safely escapes untrusted Markdown contexts, URLs, tables, code fences, and optional frontmatter |
| `export_with_fidelity_report` | Export a document with a machine-readable fidelity report | Reports unsupported inline attributes and native block loss while using the same safe serializer |

## Database blocks

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `compose_database_from_intent` | Create or enrich a database block from a high-level schema intent | Useful for project boards and structured tables |
| `add_database_column` | Add a column to a database block | Supports `title`, `rich-text`, `select`, `multi-select`, `number`, `checkbox`, `link`, and `date`; rejects a title addition when the current snapshot already contains one |
| `add_database_row` | Add a row to a database block | Rich-text and title values accept strings or delta arrays |
| `delete_database_row` | Delete a row by row block id | Destructive |
| `read_database_columns` | Read schema metadata, types, options, and view mappings | Useful before edits |
| `read_database_cells` | Read row titles and decoded cell values | Rich-text titles and cells include plain values and formatting-preserving deltas |
| `update_database_row` | Update multiple cells on a row at once | Rich-text deltas are preserved; `createOption` defaults to `true` |

## Edgeless canvas and surface elements

AFFiNE's edgeless doc has two layers: top-level edgeless blocks (`note`, `frame`, `edgeless-text`) with `prop:xywh`, and the surface layer (`affine:surface`) which stores free-floating shapes, connectors, canvas text, and groups in `prop:elements.value` — the native BlockSuite representation.

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `get_edgeless_canvas` | Read the full canvas: edgeless blocks + surface elements with parsed `{x,y,width,height}`, aggregate `bounds`, per-type `elementCounts` | Deterministic z-order (fractional-index sorted). Note entries carry a structured `children` array of their block descendants (`flavour`, `type`, `text`, `language`, `checked`) so markdown-seeded content round-trips faithfully. |
| `add_surface_element` | Add a `shape`, `connector`, `text`, or `group` to the surface | Shapes: rect/ellipse/diamond/triangle with fill, stroke, and text. Connectors accept `sourceId`/`targetId` and optional `sourcePosition`/`targetPosition` relative `[x,y]` in `[0,1]`. When both endpoints are bound by id and neither position is supplied, they auto-snap to BlockSuite's four tangent-carrying side-midpoints based on relative bounds. Creates the surface block if the doc doesn't have one. |
| `list_surface_elements` | List all surface elements (optionally filter by `type` or `elementId`) | Returns raw `xywh` plus parsed `bounds` sorted by fractional `index` ascending; serializes `Y.Text` fields to plain strings. |
| `update_surface_element` | Partially update an element by id | `x`/`y`/`width`/`height` merge with current `xywh` (move without resizing, or vice versa). `text`/`label`/`title` replace their `Y.Text` wholesale. Fields not applicable to the element's type come back in the response `ignored` list. |
| `delete_surface_element` | Delete an element by id | `pruneConnectors: true` additionally removes any connectors referencing the deleted element. |
| `update_frame_children` | Replace a frame block's contents wholesale | Every resolved id (surface element or edgeless block) goes into `prop:childElementIds` and comes back in `ownedIds`; unknown ids in `missing`. Default `resizeToFit: true` recomputes xywh to match new contents + `padding` + title band; pass `resizeToFit: false` to preserve the current box. Pass `[]` to clear ownership (resize skipped). |
| `update_edgeless_block` | Partially update a note/frame/edgeless-text block | `x`/`y`/`width`/`height` merge with current `prop:xywh`; `background` replaces `prop:background`. Fields not applicable to the flavour come back under `ignored`. Use for repositioning / resizing / recoloring without re-creating the block. |
| `delete_block` | Delete a block by id | Returns the deleted root and descendant snapshots so callers can reconstruct content. Removes descendants and unlinks from the parent's `sys:children` by default. `deleteChildren: false` keeps descendants orphaned; `pruneConnectors: true` also drops surface connectors referencing any deleted id. Refuses `affine:page`. |

### Layout helpers on `append_block`

When the new block is a frame/note/edgeless_text on the canvas, `append_block` accepts three optional fields that compute coordinates from the current doc state instead of the caller doing arithmetic:

| Field | Applies to | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `markdown` | `type="note"` | Parse markdown into heading/paragraph/list/code child blocks inside the note. Height auto-estimated from the content when `height` is omitted. |
| `childElementIds: [id, ...]` | `type="frame"` | The frame's contents. Accepts ids of surface elements (shapes/connectors/groups) AND edgeless blocks (notes/frames/edgeless-text) — every resolved id goes into `prop:childElementIds`, matching what BlockSuite's editor writes when you drag members into a frame. Dragging the frame drags every owned member. Unresolved ids come back under `missing`. If `width`/`height` are omitted, the frame is sized to the union of resolvable bounds + `padding` + a 30px title band. |
| `stackAfter: { blockId, direction?, gap? }` | any canvas block | Position relative to one or more existing siblings. `blockId` may be an array — picks whichever ref is furthest in the stack direction (useful when stacking below a row of columns) and centers the new block on the union bounds' orthogonal axis (when widths match, same as inheriting the anchor's x). Caller-provided `x` / `y` on the orthogonal axis still wins. Default `gap` is direction-aware: **80px horizontal** (left/right), **40px vertical** (up/down) — mirrors native-flowchart spacing where the flow axis gets more breathing room. |
| `padding` | used by `childElementIds` auto-sizing and as fallback `gap` for `stackAfter` | Default 40. Explicit `padding` on the block overrides the direction-aware default; explicit `stackAfter.gap` wins over both. |

## Comments

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list_comments` | List comments on a document | |
| `create_comment` | Create a comment on a document | |
| `update_comment` | Update comment content | |
| `delete_comment` | Delete a comment | Destructive |
| `resolve_comment` | Resolve or unresolve a comment | |

## Version History

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list_histories` | List document history timestamps | |

## Users and authentication

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `current_user` | Return the current signed-in user | |
| `sign_in` | Sign in with email and password | Self-hosted flows only for direct programmatic sign-in |
| `update_profile` | Update current user profile data | Requires at least one of `name` or `avatarUrl` |
| `update_settings` | Update user notification preferences | |

## Notifications

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list_notifications` | List one page of notifications for the current user | Returns a stable envelope with notification cursors, server page info, explicit counts, and filter scope |
| `read_all_notifications` | Ask AFFiNE to mark notifications as read | Check `applied` and `status`; false or failed outcomes return MCP errors with stable codes |

`list_notifications` accepts either zero-based `offset` pagination or an `after` cursor, never both. `first` is limited to 1-100, offsets must fit a GraphQL signed integer, and cursors must contain 1-2,048 characters. The response uses these fields:

- `notifications`: notification nodes from this page, each with its GraphQL edge `cursor`
- `pagination.pageInfo`: unmodified server `hasNextPage` and `endCursor` values
- `counts.serverTotalCount`: the server's total notification count before local filtering
- `counts.serverUnreadTotalCount`: always `null` because this endpoint does not provide a global unread total
- `counts.fetchedPageCount`, `unreadOnFetchedPageCount`, and `returnedCount`: explicit page-level counts
- `filter.scope`: `fetched_page` when `unreadOnly=true`, otherwise `none`

`unreadOnly` is intentionally a client-side filter over the fetched server page. It does not rewrite `serverTotalCount` or `pageInfo`; continue pagination to inspect unread notifications beyond the current page.

## Blob storage

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `upload_blob` | Upload a file or blob to workspace storage | Defaults to `encoding: "utf8"`; pass `encoding: "base64"` explicitly for binary content. The returned opaque key is accepted as image/attachment `sourceId`; it is not an external URL |
| `delete_blob` | Delete a blob from workspace storage | Permanent deletion requires `confirmKey` to exactly match `key`; false, exception, and unconfirmed outcomes return stable MCP errors |
| `cleanup_blobs` | Permanently remove deleted blobs | `confirmWorkspaceId` must exactly match `workspaceId`; false, exception, and unconfirmed outcomes return stable MCP errors |

## Native mindmaps

See the [native mindmap guide](native-mindmaps.md) for request/response fields,
an executable workflow example, validation behavior, and deployment links.

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `create_mindmap` | Create a native mindmap root in an existing document | Returns `mindmapId` and `rootId`; default style ONE |
| `get_mindmap` | Read validated topology, child order, labels, collapsed state and geometry | Discover IDs with `get_edgeless_canvas` |
| `add_mindmap_node` | Append or insert a child of `parentId` | `beforeId` must be a sibling; returns `nodeId` |
| `update_mindmap_node` | Replace text or change collapsed state | Keeps IDs and parent links |
| `reparent_mindmap_node` | Move a node and its descendants within the same map | Rejects root moves, cycles and foreign IDs |
| `set_mindmap_layout` | Persist direction and node coordinates together | `right`, `left`, `balance`; no `down`/`up` |
| `set_mindmap_style` | Apply native style and persist node appearance/size | `style`: integer 1–4; keeps hierarchy |
| `set_mindmap_lock` | Set native map lock inherited by its nodes | `locked`: boolean; retains independent node/ancestor locks |

These operations store a native `type=mindmap` element with a `Y.Map` of shape IDs
and `{index, parent?, collapsed?}` details. They do not create ordinary connectors;
BlockSuite derives its own local connectors from the hierarchy. Shape nodes only,
maximum 500 nodes and depth 64. Node removal is deliberately not exposed.

Layout values are verified against [AFFiNE 174ad9bc5](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE/blob/174ad9bc5/blocksuite/affine/model/src/consts/mindmap.ts):
RIGHT=0, LEFT=1, BALANCE=2. Downward layout requires an editor change, not a new MCP
enum value. Positions are persisted because remote changes do not trigger every
local editor watcher. Text dimensions are estimated; the native editor may refine
them when opened. The root remains anchored during layout and reparenting.

Styles ONE=1, TWO=2, THREE=3, FOUR=4 are supported by `set_mindmap_style` and
the optional creation `style` (default ONE). `set_mindmap_lock` writes native
`lockedBySelf`; effective `locked` also includes containing group locks. Other
mutations reject locked maps/nodes. Unlock keeps independent node locks intact.

Create a document with its intended `folderId` first and verify its sidebar link,
then create a root, add project children to `rootId`, and add tasks to the returned
project `nodeId`. Run hierarchy mutations sequentially. The upstream persistence
API has no compare-and-swap: simultaneous edits by independent clients can still
race; read back the map after a batch. A failed push may have an uncertain outcome,
so inspect the document before retrying creation. Existing malformed or shared
node ownership is rejected before persistence.
