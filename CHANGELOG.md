# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added eight native mindmap tools for hierarchy editing, right/left/balance layouts, four styles, and native lock/unlock, with read-only discovery, validation, and request/response documentation.
- Added `update_table_column_widths` plus `read_doc.tableColumnWidths` for reversible, content-preserving native table sizing.

### Fixed
- Declared the returned native mindmap `nodeId` in mutation output schemas; rejected reused overlay output directories and pinned the compatibility image's verified base digest.

### Tests
- Added native mindmap coverage for Yjs round trips, subtree moves, invalid topology, layout geometry, style transitions, lock inheritance, tool filtering, output contracts, and non-destructive overlay directory validation.

## [3.5.1] - 2026-09-07

### Security
- Updated locked `fast-uri` to 3.1.7 and `qs` to 6.16.0 to address reported URI parsing and query-string parsing advisories, including the required `side-channel` dependency updates.

### Added
- `append_block` now returns a `warnings` entry when a `type: "table"` call creates a table with no cell content, naming `tableData`, `tableCellDeltas` and `update_table_cell` as the ways to fill it. Creating an empty table on purpose still succeeds unchanged.

### Dependencies
- Updated locked `markdown-it` from 14.3.0 to 14.3.1, `@types/markdown-it` from 14.1.2 to 14.2.0, and `tsx` from 4.23.12 to 4.23.13.

### Tests
- Added integration coverage for empty-table warnings and filling an empty table with `update_table_cell`.

## [3.5.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- Added `update_table_cell` for in-place updates to AFFiNE table cells with zero-based coordinates and formatting-preserving rich-text deltas.

### Fixed
- `append_block` now accepts `tableData` and `tableCellDeltas`, so a table created with cell contents is no longer silently empty; previously the schema stripped both fields and only `append_markdown` could fill cells.

### Dependencies
- Updated `jose` from 6.2.9 to 6.2.10.

### Tests
- Hardened container startup smoke checks to fail immediately when the process exits and to require protected mode from the live health endpoint.

## [3.4.1] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed
- Markdown rich-text operations now use one canonical content input, so strict divider validation cannot accept and then discard non-empty delta content.
- The container now starts the HTTP server when run without arguments instead of inheriting the Node base image command and exiting; PR image checks now supply the required bearer token and wait for a healthy container.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added
- `append_block` and `update_block` now accept formatting-preserving rich-text delta arrays as well as plain strings.
- `read_doc` and block-editing snapshots now expose canonical `deltas` alongside flattened text for lossless read-modify-write flows.

### Security
- AFFiNE document and workspace identifiers now use the shared cryptographically secure identifier generator.

### Fixed
- GraphQL, sign-in, readiness, CLI, blob-upload, and workspace-creation response bodies are bounded to 16 MiB while request timeouts remain active through complete body consumption.
- Empty workspace and profile updates are rejected before reaching AFFiNE, and ignored-only surface or edgeless updates no longer push unchanged CRDT state.
- Empty rich-text delta segments that normalize to no content no longer make divider creation fail strict validation.

### Dependencies
- Aligned the locked Node.js type definitions with the minimum supported Node.js 20 runtime.

### Tests
- Expanded CI validation to Node.js 20, 22, 24, and 26.
- Added focused and browser-backed coverage for rich-text block formatting, bounded response handling, mutation input contracts, and no-op CRDT updates.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-08-24

### Added
- Added recoverable `trash_doc` and `restore_doc` tools backed by AFFiNE workspace metadata, with idempotent retries and read-back verification.
- Added `update_block` and `move_block` for in-place text-block editing, conversion, reordering, and reparenting without replacing block IDs.
- Added `title` column support for AFFiNE databases, including duplicate-title rejection and synchronized updates across every stored view representation.

### Changed
- `read_doc` now reports hierarchy-derived `parentId` values, and `delete_block` returns snapshots of removed root and descendant blocks.
- The canonical MCP tool surface now contains 96 tools.

### Fixed
- Preserved AFFiNE rich-text deltas when reading and updating database cells, while rejecting malformed rich-text inputs before mutation.
- Unknown HTTP MCP session IDs now return `404 Session not found` instead of being treated as new-session requests.
- Markdown export no longer over-escapes ordinary punctuation or ampersands and preserves unknown entity-like text.
- Markdown fidelity reports now distinguish known import losses from lossless export behavior.

### Dependencies
- Refreshed the locked `jose` release from 6.2.8 to 6.2.9.

### Tests
- Added focused and browser-backed coverage for block editing, document trash recovery, database title columns and rich-text cells, HTTP session handling, and Markdown fidelity.

## [3.2.2] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed
- The container `HEALTHCHECK` now probes `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost`, which can resolve to `::1` while the server listens on IPv4 only.
- Tool schemas are no longer advertised with the draft-07 JSON Schema dialect. The MCP SDK stamps `"$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"` onto every schema converted from Zod v3, which made clients that support JSON Schema 2020-12 only (Claude) reject every tool with `Tool has an invalid outputSchema`.

### Dependencies
- Raised `undici` from `^6.28.0` to `^7.29.0`, raised the supported Node.js floor to 20.18.1, and refreshed the locked `jose` and `yjs` releases.
- Refreshed the locked Node.js types, `tsx`, Playwright, and Docker login action releases.

## [3.2.1] - 2026-08-06

### Security
- Replaced the `affine-mcp login --cookie <value>` process-argument path with `--cookie-stdin` so browser session cookies do not appear in shell history or process listings.

### Fixed
- `affine-mcp login --workspace-id` now verifies that the requested workspace is available to the authenticated account before saving the configuration.
- `list_docs` now falls back to bounded workspace metadata pagination when AFFiNE denies ordinary workspace members access to the GraphQL document connection.

### Tests
- Added CLI regressions for stdin cookie authentication, legacy cookie redaction, inaccessible workspace rejection, and live workspace validation.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added
- Added declared MCP `outputSchema` metadata for all 92 canonical tools so ChatGPT and other clients can validate structured results and reason about follow-up calls.

### Security
- Raised the minimum MCP SDK and `undici` versions and refreshed transitive dependency locks to remediate current `@hono/node-server`, `fast-uri`, `hono`, `ip-address`, `socket.io-parser`, and `undici` advisories.

### Tests
- Added output-schema coverage and MCP round-trip validation, and included it in the default test and CI gates.
- Configured isolated comprehensive-test instances to disable AFFiNE's new-account share delay so document publish and revoke coverage runs deterministically.
- Bounded the isolated comprehensive setup sign-in and GraphQL requests to fail promptly when AFFiNE stops responding.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added
- `list_workspaces` and `get_workspace` now include best-effort workspace profile names, avatar references, direct URLs, and an explicit profile status while preserving the existing GraphQL fields and list response shape.

### Fixed
- Email/password sign-in and all GraphQL/REST requests now send the `x-affine-version` header (configurable via the new `AFFINE_CLIENT_VERSION`, default `0.26.0`). AFFiNE servers that gate on a minimum web-client version previously rejected sign-in with `403 ACTION_FORBIDDEN` (`UNSUPPORTED_CLIENT_VERSION`), leaving the MCP server unable to connect. `AFFINE_WS_CLIENT_VERSION` now falls back to `AFFINE_CLIENT_VERSION` so a single variable can govern both the HTTP and realtime-socket client versions.
- Environment authentication now overrides saved token, cookie, and authentication-header credentials as one source-scoped group, so client-provided email/password credentials cannot be masked by stale local auth state.
- Document deletion now recognizes AFFiNE 0.27.3 success acknowledgements and filters only locally acknowledged deletions from stale `list_docs` edges while upstream indexing converges.
- Acknowledged deletion tombstones now expire after ten minutes and retain at most 10,000 entries, bounding process memory while preserving the index-convergence window.
- Case-insensitive `x-affine-version` overrides now replace the default cleanly in CLI and readiness requests instead of producing duplicate header values.
- Created-workspace URLs now derive from the same canonical AFFiNE origin resolver used by workspace discovery, including custom GraphQL paths.
- Documented how to launch MCP Inspector with a named Claude Desktop server configuration instead of starting an unauthenticated standalone process.

### Tests
- Added CLI, mock-AFFiNE, and live integration regression coverage for environment email/password authentication overriding saved API tokens, cookies, and authentication headers while retaining unrelated saved headers.
- Added deterministic and live integration coverage for workspace profile enrichment, failure isolation, and the GraphQL-only `includeProfile: false` fast path.
- Hardened Playwright sign-in setup against clicks that occur before the self-hosted AFFiNE page finishes hydrating.

### Dependencies
- Updated `jose` from 6.2.3 to 6.2.4.
- Refreshed locked HTTP and URI parser dependencies, including `hono`, `body-parser`, `type-is`, and `fast-uri`, clearing the current high-severity audit finding.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- Markdown import now converts `[label](LinkedPage:<docId>)` links into native inline linked-doc references, and Markdown export serializes those references back to the same `LinkedPage:` scheme, making inline doc references round-trip safe.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-07-20

### Changed
- Breaking: aligned authentication with AFFiNE 0.27+ by making email/password and session cookies the supported current-stable paths; compatible GraphQL bearer tokens remain accepted for older deployments.
- `affine-mcp login` now saves the authenticated session cookie instead of calling the removed personal-access-token mutation, and can accept a browser session through `--cookie`.
- OAuth-protected MCP deployments can now use email/password or a session cookie for the shared AFFiNE backend service identity instead of requiring `AFFINE_API_TOKEN`.
- Empty Markdown replacements require explicit `allowEmpty: true` confirmation, and document creation responses expose repair status when a follow-up placement step fails.
- Added bounded integer schemas for pagination, search limits, history size, and tree depth.
- Permanent document, workspace, and blob cleanup operations now require an exact identifier confirmation before any AFFiNE request is sent.
- `list_notifications` now returns a stable envelope containing cursor-bearing notifications, server page info, server and page-level counts, pagination mode, and explicit filter scope.
- `unreadOnly` now reports that it filters only the fetched page and leaves server totals and page info unchanged.
- `read_all_notifications` now returns `applied` and `status`; false and exception outcomes use stable MCP error envelopes instead of success-shaped responses.
- Raised the supported Node.js runtime floor to 20 to match the installed dependency graph and added CI coverage for Node.js 20 and 24.
- Array and scalar tool results now include a stable object-shaped `structuredContent` envelope (`items`, `text`, or `value`) while preserving the existing text content for compatibility.
- Centralized GraphQL endpoint, transport, login, port, host, CORS, and HTTP bearer settings under one `environment > saved config > defaults` resolver with strict validation.
- Updated `status`, `doctor`, `show-config`, login, and generated client snippets to use the same effective configuration as the MCP runtime, including custom GraphQL paths and non-token authentication.
- Made `/readyz` verify the exact configured AFFiNE GraphQL endpoint in addition to OAuth discovery.

### Security
- Added a fail-closed guard to destructive live-test entry points. Loopback targets remain available by default, while non-loopback targets require an explicit remote opt-in and an exact `DESTROY <target>` confirmation.
- Isolated Docker-backed test runs with unique Compose projects, private per-run credential files, scoped cleanup, and collision-resistant AFFiNE resource names.
- Stopped printing acquired session cookies from the E2E credential helper.
- OAuth deployments now default to the read-only tool profile because all callers share one AFFiNE service credential.
- Write-capable OAuth tool surfaces now fail closed unless operators explicitly set `AFFINE_OAUTH_ALLOW_SERVICE_WRITES=true` in addition to selecting a write-capable profile.
- OAuth deployment guidance now distinguishes MCP caller authentication from AFFiNE backend identity delegation.

### Fixed
- `list_docs` now falls back to a query without `public` visibility metadata when AFFiNE transiently violates that field's non-null contract; affected values are returned as `null` with an explicit warning instead of failing the whole document list.
- Tool handlers now return MCP `isError: true` with stable error codes, retryability, and machine-readable context instead of reporting failures as successful text results.
- Structured receipts derive `ok` from explicit `ok`, `success`, and failed status values rather than defaulting every operation to success.
- Document moves now validate source and destination documents, reject hierarchy cycles, add the destination link before removing the source link, and report partial outcomes without orphaning the document.
- Strict Markdown mutations now abort before any server update when an operation cannot be applied, and document creation preflights strict Markdown before creating remote state.
- Document append operations now reject missing target documents instead of writing updates to an empty Yjs document.
- Hardened URL-bearing block creation with shared runtime validation and canonicalization for bookmarks, blob-backed media, internal document links, iframes, and provider embeds. Unsafe schemes, control-character parser differentials, embedded credentials, and provider host lookalikes are rejected before AFFiNE blocks are written, while exact opaque keys returned by `upload_blob` remain valid media `sourceId` values.
- Markdown export now preserves supported AFFiNE rich-text attributes across paragraphs, headings, lists, quotes, callouts, and table cells while reporting unsupported attributes as explicit fidelity loss.
- Hardened Markdown serialization prevents untrusted block text, link labels and destinations, YAML frontmatter, code fences, table cells, and placeholder metadata from injecting new Markdown structure or unsafe URL schemes; exported frontmatter is stripped when Markdown is imported again.
- Document deletion now waits for an AFFiNE WebSocket error or success acknowledgement and falls back to a `DOC_NOT_FOUND` read-after-delete check for AFFiNE versions whose successful delete handler returns no acknowledgement.
- `delete_doc` now reports workspace metadata and document-content outcomes separately, including partial and already-absent states.
- Destructive document, workspace, and blob mutations now return stable MCP failure envelopes when AFFiNE rejects, does not confirm, or only partially completes an operation.
- `delete_workspace`, `delete_blob`, and `cleanup_blobs` no longer report success when AFFiNE returns `false` or the mutation fails.
- Added fail-closed bounds for notification page size, offset, and cursor inputs, and rejected requests that combine offset and cursor pagination.
- Blob uploads now default to exact UTF-8 handling, require explicit `encoding: "base64"` for binary payloads, validate canonical Base64, and enforce configurable decoded-size, timeout, HTTP-status, and response-size safeguards.
- Blob upload timeout and validation failures now return stable MCP error envelopes with distinct codes and explicit retryability.
- Blob delete and cleanup `false` results now return `not_applied` MCP errors instead of success-shaped responses.
- Persisted document, block, property, organize, fractional-index suffix, and surface seed values now use unbiased cryptographically secure randomness instead of `Math.random` or modulo-biased bytes.
- Fixed CLI requests that always used `/graphql`, custom GraphQL paths becoming unintended Socket.IO namespaces, environment-only credentials that `status` ignored, and missing config-file values for custom headers and HTTP runtime settings.
- Corrected documented defaults for the AFFiNE base URL, HTTP bind host, transport aliases, and browser origin policy.
- Quoted Codex snippet environment arguments safely for POSIX shells and removed saved `Authorization`/`Cookie` headers during logout without deleting unrelated headers or runtime settings.
- Email/password authentication is now process-scoped and single-flight across concurrent HTTP MCP sessions, and backend requests wait for the shared result instead of falling back to anonymous access.
- Bearer, cookie, custom-header, and email/password credentials now follow one exclusive priority order across GraphQL, multipart, and WebSocket consumers.
- Failed asynchronous login state is shared by every consumer while an explicit later `sign_in` can safely establish a new cookie session.

### Removed
- Breaking: removed `list_access_tokens`, `generate_access_token`, and `revoke_access_token` because AFFiNE 0.27 removed the legacy personal-access-token GraphQL API; the canonical public tool surface is now 92 tools.

### Tests
- Added self-contained coverage for success, error, and partial receipt contracts.
- Added self-contained regression coverage for safe document move ordering, cycle rejection, partial failures, idempotent destination links, and Markdown batch failure policy.
- Added self-contained external URL safety regressions and included them in the package CI gate.
- Added focused rich-text round-trip and Markdown output-safety regressions, including injection payloads in every supported text context, and wired them into package and workflow CI gates.
- Added self-contained input-boundary, destructive-confirmation, WebSocket positive/empty/negative acknowledgement, timeout, read-after-delete, partial-failure receipt, and false-mutation regression coverage.
- Wired the focused input-contract and destructive-mutation suites into both the package `ci` script and GitHub Actions.
- Updated live cleanup callers to use the new confirmation contract.
- Added self-contained handler coverage for notification envelopes, cursor preservation, page-local unread filtering, pagination validation, and stable list/read-all failure results.
- Added a self-contained blob upload contract test covering decoding, configuration, multipart headers, response limits, timeouts, HTTP failures, and true/false/exception mutation results.
- Added a source-wide regression guard that rejects `Math.random` in runtime TypeScript and validates identifier alphabets, lengths, uniqueness, seed ranges, and invalid generator inputs.
- Added self-contained CI coverage for destructive-target validation, remote confirmation, URL normalization, and unique test resource naming.
- Added self-contained regression coverage for config precedence, custom GraphQL paths, environment-only diagnostics, HTTP runtime flags, CORS, and upstream-aware readiness.
- Added a self-contained mock AFFiNE regression suite for concurrent authentication, async request gating, credential exclusivity, failure propagation, and explicit recovery.
- Added regression coverage for OAuth read-only defaults, explicit write acknowledgement, profile handling, and fully disabled write surfaces.

### Dependencies
- Updated GitHub Actions setup-node usage to v7.
- Refreshed locked TypeScript, Node.js type, and `tsx` development dependencies.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- Added Glama server metadata and included it in the published npm package.
- Added MCP tool behavior annotations (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, and `openWorldHint`) to registered tools so clients can classify read, write, and destructive operations more safely.
- Included `SECURITY.md` in the published npm package.

### Changed
- Improved descriptions and parameter schemas for auth, access token, blob, comment, document, notification, organize, tag, and user tools.
- Refreshed README and HTTP deployment guidance for auth-protected probes, CORS, TLS, and stricter production settings.

### Tests
- Strengthened tool filtering coverage to assert MCP annotations are exposed through `tools/list`.

### Dependencies
- Refreshed `fractional-indexing` from `^3.2.0` to `^4.0.0`.
- Refreshed locked `markdown-it` entries from `14.2.0` to `14.3.0`.
- Refreshed `@types/node` from `^25.2.3` to `^26.0.1`.
- Refreshed Playwright lockfile entries from `1.61.0` to `1.61.1`.
- Refreshed `tsx` lockfile entries from `4.22.4` to `4.22.5`.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- `delete_tag` removes a workspace-level tag and detaches it from every document that references it, mirroring AFFiNE's own tag deletion (drops the option from `meta.properties.tags.options` and strips the tag id from each `pages[*].tags`, then syncs affected document metadata). Accepts a tag id or name; an ambiguous name is rejected with the candidate ids. Belongs to the `docs.tags` and `destructive` tool groups.

### Changed
- Document listing, search, tag listing, hierarchy, child, and orphan flows now surface `inTrash` so MCP clients can distinguish active and trashed documents without extra lookups.

### Tests
- Added Docker-backed regression coverage for `delete_tag` (`tests/test-tag-deletion.mjs`) and wired it into the E2E pipeline.

### Dependencies
- Refreshed `actions/checkout` to `v7` across CI, E2E, Docker, and npm publish workflows.
- Refreshed Playwright lockfile entries from `1.60.0` to `1.61.0`.
- Refreshed `undici` from `^8.0.2` to `^6.27.0`, clearing the current high-severity audit finding while preserving Node 18/20 compatibility.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- `update_doc_icon` / `update_folder_icon` — set or clear the Notion-style sidebar icon on a document or organize folder. Accepts an emoji shorthand (`"🧪"`), a full object (`{type:"emoji",unicode:"🧪"}` or `{type:"icon",name:"check"}`), or `null` to remove the icon while keeping the entry referenceable. `update_folder_icon` is experimental, mirroring the rest of the organize-folder family.
- `get_doc_icon` / `get_folder_icon` — read the current sidebar icon of a document or folder (returns `null` when none is set).
- `src/util/explorerIcon.ts` — shared helper targeting the `db$<workspaceId>$explorerIcon` workspace sub-doc and per-entity Y.Map (`doc:<id>` / `folder:<id>`) where AFFiNE 0.26+ stores per-doc/per-folder sidebar icons.

### Fixed
- `list_children`, `list_workspace_tree`, and `get_orphan_docs` now recognize inline `LinkedPage` references and synced-doc embeds in addition to `embed_linked_doc` blocks, so inline-nested docs no longer appear flat or orphaned.
- Hierarchy tools now skip database-row title references and filter stale or external inline references when workspace metadata is available.

### Tests
- Added Docker-backed E2E coverage for sidebar icon read/write flows and wired it into the E2E validation pipeline.

### Dependencies
- Refreshed locked dependency entries for `form-data`, `hono`, `engine.io-client`, `ws`, and `hasown`, clearing current high-severity audit findings.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- Document custom-property tools backed by the AFFiNE WorkspaceDB Yjs sub-docs (`db$docProperties`, `db$docCustomPropertyInfo`): `list_doc_properties`, `create_custom_property`, `delete_custom_property`, `set_doc_property`, and `clear_doc_property`. Supports `text`, `number`, `checkbox`, and `date` property types, with values resolvable by property id or name. Adds the `docs.properties` tool group.

### Fixed
- `read_doc` block rows now expose inline LinkedPage reference IDs through `linkedDocIds`, preserving `@`-mention targets stored in Y.Text delta attributes.
- Table row and column ordering now uses valid fractional-indexing keys when rows or columns are appended through MCP tools.
- Table extraction now preserves fractional-index key order without locale collation.
- Date custom-property values now reject semantically invalid calendar dates.

### Tests
- Added Docker-backed regression coverage for document custom properties, database linked-doc rows, and `read_doc` inline LinkedPage references, and wired those flows into comprehensive and E2E validation.
- Document custom-property regression cleanup now removes the test-created doc and workspace.

### Dependencies
- Refreshed locked dependency entries for `esbuild`, `qs`, `markdown-it`, `yjs`, `tsx`, and `@types/node`, clearing current high-severity audit findings.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- `find_doc_by_title` resolves exact document-title matches from workspace metadata, supports optional case-insensitive matching, returns every match up to a configurable limit, and reports whether results were truncated.
- `create_doc` now accepts `folderId` so newly created docs can be placed directly inside an existing AFFiNE sidebar folder.
- CodeRabbit auto-review configuration now covers `develop` and `release/*` branches.

### Changed
- npm publishing now uses GitHub Actions trusted publishing with OIDC on Node.js 24 instead of an `NPM_TOKEN` secret.
- Docker image publishing now runs on release tags or manual dispatch only, keeping develop PR checks focused on code validation.

### Fixed
- `create_doc` now links folder placement through the organize tree and returns explicit folder placement receipt fields, with warnings when folder placement fails after document creation.
- `find_doc_by_title` now only marks responses as truncated when matches exceed the requested limit and falls back to creation time when workspace metadata has no updated time.

### Security
- Refreshed locked transitive dependencies to clear npm audit findings, including `hono`, `@hono/node-server`, `express-rate-limit`, `path-to-regexp`, `socket.io-parser`, `ws`, `ajv`, `fast-uri`, and `ip-address`.

### Tests
- Added coverage for `find_doc_by_title` and `create_doc` folder placement, and wired both flows into comprehensive and E2E validation.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- First-class edgeless canvas support on the native BlockSuite schema (no overlay types). Eight new tools cover the full surface: `add_surface_element`, `list_surface_elements`, `update_surface_element`, `delete_surface_element` (shapes, connectors, canvas text, groups on `affine:surface` → `prop:elements`), plus `update_edgeless_block`, `delete_block`, `update_frame_children`, and `get_edgeless_canvas` — closing the gap where notes, frames, and edgeless-text blocks were append-only.
- Layout helpers on `append_block`: `x` / `y` for canvas blocks, `stackAfter` for direction-aware placement relative to one or more siblings (default gap 80px horizontal / 40px vertical, orthogonal-axis centering), `childElementIds` to write `prop:childElementIds` like the editor's drag-into-frame flow so dragging the frame drags every owned member. When `y` is omitted, new edgeless blocks stack below the bottommost existing block.
- `get_edgeless_canvas` returns edgeless blocks with parsed `{x, y, width, height}`, all surface elements with bounds, aggregate bounding box, per-type counts, and structured `children[]` per note so markdown-seeded content round-trips with heading / list / code semantics. Z-order is deterministic (fractional-index sort).
- Connector auto-snap: when both endpoints are bound by id and positions are omitted, `add_surface_element(type="connector")` picks one of BlockSuite's four tangent-carrying side-midpoints using the editor's tiered axis rule. `labelXYWH` is seeded at the source→target midpoint so labels render on first paint.
- Markdown-seeded notes: `append_block(type="note", markdown: "...")` parses into heading / paragraph / list / code child blocks, mirroring BlockSuite's paste-into-note behavior. `append_block(type="edgeless_text", text: "…")` auto-attaches a child paragraph so the block renders glyphs.
- `src/edgeless/layout.ts` — dependency-free pure-function layout module (`pickConnectorSides`, `stackRelativeTo`, `encloseBounds`, `estimateNoteHeightForMarkdown`, `sortByFractionalIndex`, …).
- `docs/edgeless-canvas-cookbook.md` worked walkthrough; `tests/test-canvas-tool-map-demo.mjs` doubles as the regression guard for stacking, frame ownership, connector snapping, and label seeding, wired into `tests/run-e2e.sh`.
- Tool surface profiles via `AFFINE_TOOL_PROFILE=full`, `read_only`, `core`, or `authoring` for least-privilege deployments.

### Changed
- Breaking: the public tool surface was reduced from the unreleased 95 registered tools to 84 canonical tools by removing redundant convenience tools and consolidating overlapping flows behind the canonical APIs.
- `get_capabilities`, `tool-manifest.json`, and `tools/list` now report the same public surface, including profile-filtered views.

### Fixed
- `extractTableData` now reads `affine:table` blocks stored with flat dot-notation Y.js keys (`prop:rows.{rowId}.order`, `prop:columns.{colId}.order`, `prop:cells.{rowId}:{colId}.text`) used by self-hosted AFFiNE instances. Previously `block.get("prop:rows")` returned `undefined` for this schema, causing all table exports to show empty tables with `had no readable cell data` warnings.
- Caller-supplied note `background` strings are no longer silently replaced with the default Y.Map. The default-background helper is now shared across note creation and template instantiation so they cannot drift.
- Default stroke and text colors on surface connectors, canvas text, and edgeless-text blocks moved off hardcoded `#000000` onto `--affine-text-primary-color`, restoring legibility in dark mode. Shape labels stay at `#000000` to match AFFiNE's native `shapeTextColor` (shape fills are fixed palette colors).
- Tool filtering now fails closed when profiles or disabled-tool configuration reference unknown tools.

### Removed
- Removed redundant public tools: `append_paragraph`, `batch_create_docs`, `cleanup_orphan_embeds`, `create_doc_from_template`, `duplicate_doc`, `find_and_replace`, `get_doc_by_title`, `get_docs_by_tag`, `list_backlinks`, `list_unresolved_threads`, and `update_database_cell`.

### Tests
- Added focused coverage for tool surface profile filtering and manifest consistency.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- High-level AFFiNE-native workflows:
  - `create_semantic_page`
  - `append_semantic_section`
  - `compose_database_from_intent`
  - `inspect_template_structure`
  - `instantiate_template_native`
  - `get_capabilities`
  - `analyze_doc_fidelity`
  - `export_with_fidelity_report`
  - `update_collection_rules`
  - `create_workspace_blueprint`
  - `list_unresolved_threads`
- Structured mutation receipts for write-oriented document, workspace, and comment flows.
- Productized documentation under `docs/` with dedicated getting-started, client setup, deployment, workflow, and tool reference guides.

### Changed
- Tool surface expanded from 76 to 87 canonical tools.
- Document creation and duplication flows now support placement-aware creation and richer machine-readable receipts.
- Native template, fidelity, and capability workflows now surface explicit loss-risk and feature support metadata.
- Release and setup documentation now include first-class Docker and HTTP deployment paths.

### Fixed
- Rich-text marks are preserved for paragraphs, headings, quotes, and callouts instead of degrading to raw markdown syntax.
- `list_docs` now treats timestamp-only tombstone snapshots as deleted documents, preventing stale GraphQL edges from resurfacing after `delete_doc`.
- Document discovery end-to-end coverage now waits for eventual workspace convergence after delete/list synchronization.

### Tests
- Added live regression coverage for structured receipts, semantic page composition, placement-aware document creation, intent-driven databases, capability/fidelity reporting, native templates, organize flows, and supporting tools.
- Re-ran full Docker-backed Playwright validation through `npm run test:e2e`.

### Dependencies
- Refreshed GitHub Actions and runtime/development dependencies, including `actions/github-script`, `actions/checkout`, `docker/build-push-action`, `docker/metadata-action`, `docker/login-action`, `docker/setup-buildx-action`, `undici`, and `@types/node`.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- Database rows can now point to linked AFFiNE documents via `linkedDocId` on `add_database_row`, `update_database_cell`, and `update_database_row`. `read_database_cells` now returns `linkedDocId` when present.
- Release tags now publish multi-arch GHCR images with a committed Docker runtime (`Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, `.github/workflows/docker.yml`) and documented container startup instructions.

### Fixed
- Database row read, update, and delete flows now work for rows created from the AFFiNE UI, even when the row is attached through database children instead of `sys:parent`.
- `extractTableData` now reads `affine:table` blocks stored with flat dot-notation Y.js keys (`prop:rows.{rowId}.order`, `prop:columns.{colId}.order`, `prop:cells.{rowId}:{colId}.text`) used by self-hosted AFFiNE instances. Previously `block.get("prop:rows")` returned `undefined` for this schema, causing table exports to show empty tables with `had no readable cell data` warnings.

### Tests
- Added live regression coverage for linked database rows in `tests/test-database-linked-doc.mjs`.
- Added live regression coverage for UI-created database rows in `tests/test-database-ui-rows.mjs`.

### Dependencies
- Refreshed locked dependencies used by verification flows, including `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` `1.29.0` and `@playwright/test` `1.59.1`.

## [1.11.2] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- `list_docs` now filters out deleted documents that briefly remain in GraphQL edges after workspace metadata has already dropped them.
- Completed the delete/list_docs hardening introduced in `v1.11.1` so the visible edge list, `totalCount`, and `endCursor` stay aligned after `delete_doc`.

### Tests
- Re-ran live delete/list regression coverage against Dockerized AFFiNE `0.26.4` with `tests/test-doc-discovery.mjs`.

## [1.11.1] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- `list_docs` now clamps stale `totalCount` metadata after `delete_doc` removes a document but AFFiNE GraphQL still reports the pre-delete count.
- `list_docs.pageInfo.endCursor` now aligns with the last returned edge cursor after delete-driven metadata drift.

### Tests
- Added live regression coverage for delete/list count correction in `tests/test-doc-discovery.mjs`.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-03-27

- Markdown import now preserves inline rich-text marks in list items and table cells.
- CLI setup now supports non-interactive login with `affine-mcp login --url ... --token ... --workspace-id ... --force`.
- `affine-mcp status --json` now returns machine-readable connection details.
- `affine-mcp snippet all --env` now prints Claude, Cursor, and Codex setup in a single response.
- README and release-facing docs now describe organize tools, tool filtering, and the new database row delete workflow.

### Fixed
- Table-cell and list-item markdown imports no longer keep literal `**...**` markers when AFFiNE rich-text attributes should be written.

### Dependencies
- Refreshed GitHub Actions, runtime lockfile entries, and development tooling, including `actions/github-script`, `jose`, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `undici`, `yjs`, `typescript`, and `@types/node`.

## [1.10.1] - 2026-03-18

### Changed
- Refreshed packaged `README.md` and release metadata so the published v1.10.x docs match the shipped toolset.
- `.github/workflows/npm-publish.yml` now runs Docker-backed `npm run test:e2e` before `npm publish`.

  - `find_and_replace`
  - `update_doc_title`
- Optional OAuth-protected HTTP mode for remote MCP deployments.
- Focused HTTP transport regression coverage for bearer, OAuth, and email/password multi-session flows.

### Changed
- Toolset expanded from 47 to 61 canonical tools.
- CLI usability and setup guidance improved with richer diagnostics and ready-to-paste config snippets.
- `test:e2e` now validates HTTP email/password multi-session auth alongside bearer and OAuth HTTP coverage.

### Fixed
- `list_docs` titles are restored from workspace metadata snapshots.
- HTTP transport now preserves email/password credentials across fresh sessions so repeated Streamable HTTP connections can re-authenticate successfully.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- `read_database_columns` to expose database schema metadata for empty or sparsely populated AFFiNE databases.
- Preset-backed `data_view` creation for kanban-oriented AFFiNE database views.
- Focused supporting-tools regression coverage via `npm run test:supporting-tools`.
- Markdown callout round-trips for admonition-style import/export flows.

### Changed
- `test:comprehensive` now self-bootstraps a local Docker AFFiNE stack and provides a raw mode for pre-provisioned environments.
- `test:e2e` now isolates Docker stacks per run and seeds data-view state before Playwright verification.
- README release history was trimmed in favor of dedicated changelog and release-note sources.

### Fixed
- Empty database workflows no longer depend on existing rows to discover column names, IDs, types, and view mappings.
- Reduced Docker bootstrap flakiness in the E2E pipeline by isolating Compose projects and staging startup checks.

### Changed
- Tool surface expanded from 43 to 46 canonical tools.
- Database workflows now support row title persistence and cell-level sync for Kanban-oriented databases.
- README and release documentation now describe the new database cell workflows and CLI version support.

### Fixed
- `add_database_row` now persists `title` / `Title` into the built-in row paragraph used by AFFiNE Kanban card headers.
- CLI version handling now exits early without starting the server, including forwarded wrapper args such as `affine-mcp -- --version`.

## [1.7.2] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- Tag visibility regression coverage in Docker E2E:
  - MCP setup scenario: `tests/test-tag-visibility.mjs`
  - Playwright UI verification: `tests/playwright/verify-tag-visibility.pw.ts`
- Docker E2E credential bootstrap retry controls:
  - `AFFINE_HEALTH_MAX_RETRIES`
  - `AFFINE_HEALTH_INTERVAL_MS`
  - `AFFINE_CREDENTIAL_ACQUIRE_RETRIES`
  - `AFFINE_CREDENTIAL_RETRY_DELAY_SECONDS`

### Changed
- Tag persistence now aligns with AFFiNE tag option schema by storing canonical tag option IDs and normalizing legacy tag entries.
- Tag-facing tool outputs now resolve option IDs back to labels for stable UX parity (`read_doc`, `list_docs`, `list_tags`, `list_docs_by_tag`, markdown export).
- Docker E2E credential bootstrap now emits health-check configuration and retries credential acquisition before failing.

### Fixed
- Resolved issue where tags persisted via MCP were not visible in the AFFiNE UI.
- Reduced CI flakiness from transient AFFiNE container startup timing by adding retry and on-failure Docker diagnostics.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-03-03

### Changed
- MCP-created document block hierarchy now follows AFFiNE UI parity by writing `sys:parent` as `null` and relying on `sys:children` relationships.
- Placement resolution for `append_block` (`beforeBlockId` / `afterBlockId`) now resolves parent context from child links when `sys:parent` is null.
- Workspace bootstrap document blocks were aligned to the same null-parent shape for consistency.

### Fixed
- Resolved UI invisibility/inconsistency risk for MCP-created docs caused by parent linkage mismatch versus UI-created docs.
- Fixed callout rendering parity by creating/storing callout text in a child paragraph block so text is visible in AFFiNE UI.
- Added regression assertions in Docker E2E scripts to verify null-parent structure after `create_doc`, `append_paragraph`, and `create_doc_from_markdown`.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- Optional HTTP deployment mode with Streamable HTTP endpoint `/mcp` and backward-compatible legacy endpoints (`/sse`, `/messages`) for remote MCP clients.
- New `start:http` npm script (`MCP_TRANSPORT=http node dist/index.js`) for one-command HTTP mode startup.
- HTTP runtime dependencies and typings for remote hosting (`express`, `cors`, `@types/express`, `@types/cors`).

- Interactive CLI subcommands: `affine-mcp login`, `affine-mcp status`, `affine-mcp logout`.
- End-to-end verification pipeline with Docker and Playwright (`tests/run-e2e.sh`, `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`).
- New npm test commands: `test:e2e`, `test:db-create`, `test:bearer`, `test:playwright`.

### Changed
- Tool surface expanded from 32 to 43 canonical tools.
- Runtime server version now resolves from `package.json` through `src/config.ts` (`VERSION`) and is reused by runtime/CLI user-agent headers.
- Authentication/bootstrap flow supports config-file fallback (`~/.config/affine-mcp/config`) and Bearer headers across GraphQL/WebSocket paths.
- `list_docs` now enriches each document node with tags from workspace metadata snapshots.
- Added markdown and E2E test dependencies in package metadata (`markdown-it`, `@types/markdown-it`, `@playwright/test`).
- `workspaces` and `blobStorage` tools now use typed `GraphQLClient` accessors and shared bearer/cookie propagation.
- `test-comprehensive.mjs` now asserts tag workflows and markdown roundtrip workflows.

### Fixed
